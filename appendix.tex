The GROMACS developers will have to review and accept the code changes that I have created. If the changes in the GROMACS code are accepted, the developers will maintain the code. Before they accept the changes they have to review it closely. They take on a majority of the responsibility. If not, then new releases break the code.

Simulations are set up as a standard expanded ensemble simulation with one modification. To use AIM set lmc-move = aim. The output of AIM will be in the log file of your simulation run.

The edited files are included in a github repository:\\ https://github.com/bioSandMan/gmx514.
