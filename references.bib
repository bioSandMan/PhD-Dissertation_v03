abstract = {A review.  Mol. dynamics (MD) allows the study of biol. and chem. systems at the atomistic level on timescales from femtoseconds to milliseconds.  It complements expt. while also offering a way to follow processes difficult to discern with exptl. techniques.  Numerous software packages exist for conducting MD simulations of which one of the widest used is termed Amber.  Here, we outline the most recent developments, since version 9 was released in Apr. 2006, of the Amber and AmberTools MD software packages, referred to here as simply the Amber package.  The latest release represents six years of continued development, since version 9, by multiple research groups and the culmination of over 33 years of work beginning with the first version in 1979.  The latest release of the Amber package, version 12 released in Apr. 2012, includes a substantial no. of important developments in both the scientific and computer science arenas.  We present here a condensed vision of what Amber currently supports and where things are likely to head over the coming years.  Figure 1 shows the performance in ns/day of the Amber package version 12 on a single-core AMD FX-8120 8-Core 3.6GHz CPU, the Cray XT5 system, and a single GPU GTX680. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {The 2014 epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has had a devastating impact in West Africa. Sequencing of ebolavirus (EBOV) from infected individuals has revealed extensive genetic variation, leading to speculation that the virus may be adapting to humans, accounting for the scale of the 2014 outbreak. We computationally analyze the variation associated with all EVD outbreaks, and find none of the amino acid replacements lead to identifiable functional changes. These changes have minimal effect on protein structure, being neither stabilizing nor destabilizing, are not found in regions of the proteins associated with known functions and tend to cluster in poorly constrained regions of proteins, specifically intrinsically disordered regions. We find no evidence that the difference between the current and previous outbreaks is due to evolutionary changes associated with transmission to humans. Instead, epidemiological factors are likely to be responsible for the unprecedented spread of EVD.},

  abstract = {The objective of this work is to develop a bearing using high temperature
	superconductors (HTSs) for use in an energy storage flywheel. The
	experimental apparatus includes a cylindrical rotor levitated with
	the Evershed design in which the majority of the levitation force
	is provided by a permanent magnet arrangement and the stabilization
	of the system is achieved by HTS elements. The design characteristics
	and dynamics of the bearing associated with the rotor part are presented.
	The instrumentation measures the out of balance force and magnetomechanical
	stiffness associated with the rotor. A study of the rotational losses
	was performed using free spin down experiments associated with magnetic

	levitation devices are strongly dependent on the properties of its
	components, such as the geometry, dimensions, cooling process or
	critical-current density of the superconductor. In this work we study
	these dependences in levitating systems consisting of a superconductor
	and a permanent-magnet guideway with translational symmetry. Using
	a model based on the critical-state approximation and a magnetic-energy
	minimization procedure, we analyse for the field and zero-field cooling
	cases, the influence of some parameters of the system, such as the
	width and the critical-current density of the superconductor and
	the height of the permanent magnets, on the levitation force and
	stability. From the calculated results we provide hints of how, by
	modifying some features of the systems, one can optimize either the
	levitation force, or the stability, or a combination of both.},
